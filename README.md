Originally I wanted to make this a game similar to 6 Degrees of Kevin Bacon,
but this proved to be too hard for someone new to Flutter.
Also the OMDb didnt allow for it due to the availablitity of some of the
information needed for that sort of game. Hence the old name being used a lot
in the program files which was six_degrees.

This is best ran on desktop
To Run, go to lib/main.dart and run this file
